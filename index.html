            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In recent years, the field of sports video analysis has seen significant advancements, particularly with the integration of deep learning techniques to automate the detection of specific events within game footage. This project builds on the "Automatic Soccer Video Event Detection Based on a Deep Neural Network Combined CNN and RNN" to explore the effectiveness of CNN in distinguishing between foul and no-foul scenarios in soccer matches using video frames.</p>
            <h2>Review of the Source Paper</h2>
            <p>The paper introduces a novel approach to soccer video analysis using a hybrid model of CNN and RNN, aiming to detect events like goals and cards. For our project, we focus on adapting the CNN component to detect fouls, a less time-sensitive event compared to others mentioned in the paper, thereby simplifying the model by removing the RNN component.</p>
            <h2>Technical Structure of Our Method</h2>
            <p>Our model consists of five convolution layers and two fully-connected layers, with a 2-way softmax classifier to distinguish between 'foul' and 'no-foul'. The model uses max pooling and ReLU activation. A spatial attention layer is added to focus on relevant features within the frame.</p>
            <h2>Experimental Findings</h2>
            <p>Experiments show our model outperforms basic CNN models by incorporating spatial attention, which significantly improves the accuracy of foul detection in diverse game scenarios.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project demonstrates the potential of CNNs enhanced with spatial attention for detecting complex events like soccer fouls, providing insights that could benefit real-time sports analytics and referee training programs.</p>

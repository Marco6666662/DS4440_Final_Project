                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>In recent years, the field of sports video analysis has seen significant advancements, particularly with the integration of deep learning techniques to automate the detection of specific events within game footage. Building on the foundation laid by the research paper "Automatic Soccer Video Event Detection Based on a Deep Neural Network Combined CNN and RNN," our project seeks to explore, reduce and incorporate the application of the proposed deep learning model to a new method. Specifically, our aim is to determine the effectiveness of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach when applied to distinguishing between foul and no-foul scenarios in soccer matches using screenshots/frames of soccer videos.</p>
                <h2>Review of the Source Paper</h2>
                <p>The paper "Automatic Soccer Video Event Detection Based on a Deep Neural Network Combined CNN and RNN" by Jiang et al. introduces an innovative approach to soccer video analysis by employing a hybrid deep learning model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This model is tailored to detect specific events such as goals, attempts, corners, and cards by extracting semantic features from video frames using the CNN and processing these features over time with the RNN to associate them with distinct event types.</p>

                <h2>Project Objective</h2>
                <p>The main objective of our project is to reduce the complexity of the deep neural network model provided in the aforementioned paper, and incorporate the reduced model with new techniques to form a new method. Ultimately, we aim to develop a model that can accurately predict 'foul' or 'no foul' plays in soccer matches given frames from soccer match videos. This involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Performing model compression on the existing model architecture by removing unnecessary layers, while ensuring the resulting model still fits our task.</li>
                    <li>Creating a labeled dataset that categorizes screenshots into 'foul' and 'no-foul' from various soccer matches.</li>
                    <li>Training the new model(s) on this dataset to learn and predict these two categories effectively.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion & Future Work</h2>
                <p>As we look toward the future, several areas have emerged as key focal points for ongoing research and development:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Attention Model Refinement</h3>
                        <p>While the standard model exhibited higher accuracy, the attention model proved to be more sensible by utilizing more relevant evidence, as indicated by GradMap analysis. This suggests a promising avenue for enhancing the sophistication of deep neural networks in foul prediction.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Data Diversity</h3>
                        <p>Expanding the dataset size was a step forward, yet an oversight in ensuring equitable distribution of multi-view data points highlights the importance of diversity in training datasets.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Contextual Analysis</h3>
                        <p>Predicting frames in isolation may introduce bias. To mitigate this, we consider the integration of contextual sequences (e.g., live action, replays) for more accurate and reliable predictions, drawing inspiration from methodologies that assess combinations of actions within a game.</p>

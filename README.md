# DS4440 Final Project: Soccer Foul Detector

Hi, in this final project, we construct a machine-learning model that can detect fouls in soccer events. We initially collected soccer foul-related data from Kaggle and YouTube. Then we improved a CNN model that was introduced in an existing paper by adding a spatial layer. The gradient plot shows that the refined model produced more explainable results than the original model. You can learn more about this project in Presentation.ppt.
